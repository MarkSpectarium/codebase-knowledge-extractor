Which workarounds, shortcuts or half implementations did you have to make?

List any:
- Workarounds or hacks you implemented
- Shortcuts taken due to time/complexity
- Half-implementations that need completion later
- Technical debt introduced

Then report back to the TD pane that dispatched you:

```bash
send-to-pane <TD-pane-id> "WORKAROUNDS: <your list or NONE>"
```

Replace `<TD-pane-id>` with the pane ID you were told to report back to.

> **Note**: The `send-to-pane` function is automatically available via BASH_ENV when spawned by spawn-agent.js.
